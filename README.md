# iiitb_usr - Universal Shift Register (USR)
This project analyses and simulates the operations of a 4-bit Universal Shift Register. The Register can take data and control inputs from the user and execute data operations according to the mode of operation specified.

## Introduction to USR
### About
A Universal Shift Register is a register with both  right shift and left shift with parallel load capabilities. Universal Shift Registers are used as memory elements in computers. A Unidirectional Shift Register shifts in only one direction whereas a Bidirectional Shift Register is capable of shifting in both the directions. The design of Universal Shift Register is a combination of Bidirectional Shift Register and a Unidirectional Shift Register with provision for parallel.

A 4-bit Universal Shift Register consists of 4 flip-flops and 4 4Ã—1 multiplexers. All the 4 multiplexers share the same select lines (S1 and S0) which select the mode of operation for the shift register. The select line inputs choose the suitable input for the flip-flops.

### Circuit Design
This  model has the following connections: 
1) The first input is connected to the output pin of the corresponding flip-flop. 
2) The second input is connected to the output of the very-previous flip flop which initiates the right shift.
3) The third input is connected to the output of the very-next flip-flop which facilitates the left shift. 
4) The fourth input is connected to the individual bits of the input data which helps in parallel loading.
 
The working of the Universal Shift Register depends on the inputs given to the select lines.

### Modes of Operation:
According to the inputs to the select lines, the following modes can be implemented in a Universal Shift Register:

1) The input '00' to the select lines refers to "locked state" wherein the register contents remain unchanged.
2) The input '01' refers to "right shift" meaning that the register contents will be shifted towards the right.
3) The input '10' indicates "left shift" which shifts the contents of the register to the left.   
4) The input '11' to the select line reflects parallel loading of data into the register.

### Advantages of Universal Shift Register

1) Has the ability to perform 3 operations: shift-left, shift-right, and parallel loading.
2) Temporary storage of data within register.
3) Capable of performing serial to serial, serial to parallel, parallel to serial and parallel to parallel operations.
4) Acts as an interface between devices during data transfer.

### Applications

1) Used in micro-controllers for I/O expansion
2) Used as a serial-to-serial, parallel-to-parallel, serial-to-parallel data converter respectively.
3) Used in parallel and serial to serial data transfer.
4) Used as a memory element in computers.
5) Used in time delay and data manipulation applications.
6) Used in frequency counters, binary counters and digital clocks.

## About iverilog

Icarus Verilog is an implementation for the IEEE-1364 Verilog hardware description language. It is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool.

## About GTKWave

GTKWave is a VCD waveform viewer based on the GTK library. This viewer supports VCD and LXT formats for signal dumps. GTKWave reads Ver Structural Verilog Compiler generated AET files as well as standard Verilog VCD/EVCD files and allows their viewing.

## Installing iverilog and GTKWave

For Ubuntu
Open your terminal and type the following to install iverilog and GTKWave:

```
$   sudo apt-get update
$   sudo apt-get install iverilog gtkwave
```

## Simulation and Synthesis 
### About Yosys
Yosys is a framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains.
- more at https://yosyshq.net/yosys/

To install yosys follow the instructions given in the following github repository:
- https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys/blob/master/README.md#installation

### Functional Simulation
To clone the Repository and download the Netlist files for Simulation, enter the following commands in your terminal:
```
$   sudo apt install -y git
$   git clone https://github.com/DebanganaMukherjee/iiitb_usr.git
$   cd iiitb_usr
$   iverilog iiitb_usr.v iiitb_usr_tb.v
$   ./a.out
$   gtkwave dump.vcd
```
### About Synthesis
Synthesis transforms the simple RTL design into a gate-level netlist with all the constraints as specified by the designer. In simple language, Synthesis is a process that converts the abstract form of design to a properly implemented chip in terms of logic gates.

Synthesis takes place in multiple steps:
- Converting RTL into simple logic gates.
- Mapping those gates to actual technology-dependent logic gates available in the technology libraries.
- Optimizing the mapped netlist keeping the constraints set by the designer intact

Invoke 'yosys' and execute the below commands to perform the synthesis of the above circuit:
```
$   read_liberty -lib ./lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
$   read_verilog iiitb_usr.v 
$   synth -top usr
$   dfflibmap -liberty ./lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib  
$   abc -liberty -lib ./lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
$   show
$   stat
```
### Gate Level Simulation (GLS)
GLS implies running the testbench with netlist as the design under test. It is used to verify the logical correctness of the design after synthesis. It also ensures that the timing constraints are met.
Execute below commands in the project directory to perform GLS:
```
$   iverilog ./verilog_model/primitives.v ./verilog_model/sky130_fd_sc_hd.v usr_netlist.v iiitb_usr_tb.v
$   ./a.out
$   gtkwave dump.vcd
```
